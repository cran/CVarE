Description: Implementation of the CVE (Conditional Variance Estimation) method
  proposed by Fertl, L. and Bura, E. (2021) <arXiv:2102.08782> and the ECVE
  (Ensemble Conditional Variance Estimation) method introduced in
  Fertl, L. and Bura, E. (2021) <arXiv:2102.13435>.
  CVE and ECVE are sufficient dimension reduction methods
  in regressions with continuous response and predictors. CVE applies to general
  additive error regression models while ECVE generalizes to non-additive error
  regression models. They operate under the assumption that the predictors can
  be replaced by a lower dimensional projection without loss of information.
  It is a semiparametric forward regression model based exhaustive sufficient
  dimension reduction estimation method that is shown to be consistent under mild
  assumptions.
